          <p>
            I am a 25 year old Software Engineer based in Haridwar, India. I have 2 years of experience in the world of
            design and code and have built products both on my own and in a team.
            I started my career as a Front End Developer at Rubico IT.<br> Since then I have built projects in various
            frameworks such as React Native, React and Ionic. I love the feeling of making something useful or anything
            which enhances the lifestyle of users who uses my application or sites.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside Coding, I write quite a lot and release articles and blogs sometimes. You can find my blog here.
            When
            I
            am free usually I end up doing some code over the weekends or visit some places (not really but sometimes).
            Other than that I love to write stories and poems and this hobby of mine makes me complete and also
            enhances
            my
            ability to see the world around me with different perspective which later helps in developing code as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the last one year I have been thinking of making my bucketlist but usually I end up procrastinating.
            But
            soon you can find I am upto in the Bucketlist column of this site.
            Feel free to contact me via my social media links on the homepage. Maybe together we can make this world a
            better place.
          </p>

                    When you try doing things perfectly there is no doubt you would
                    end up doing it wrong. I am not saying perfection doesn't exist
                    but what it takes comes from experience. The fear of doing
                    something wrong or taking wrong decisions is what makes us weak.
                    <p>
                      I have made lots of mistakes in my short span of life and
                      believe me doing mistakes is what makes you experienced and
                      strong. I would rather be a old man regretting my mistakes than
                      being a person who feels sorry for himself wondering what he could have done when he had all that time.
                    </p>
                    <p>Feel free to take wrong turns, walk those
                      paths less travelled, say what you want. Do what makes you happy now. We don't know what future has for us, instead
                      of
                      being scared of it. I choose to be optimistic and pretend that all is well and will always will.
                    </p>
